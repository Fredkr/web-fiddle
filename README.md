# web-fiddle

web-fiddle is a simple little node app that allows you to easily test html/css/js natively in your browser.
Inspired by the likes of jsFiddle, Code Pen & JS Bin. The difference is with this you can use your editor of choice & launch it in any browser to make sure it renders correctly.
